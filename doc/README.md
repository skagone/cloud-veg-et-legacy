repository on all things to compute VegET model in the cloud

## Evapotranspiration Modeling in AWS using the PANGEO Architecture

This project will investigate the possibilities to create the Veg ET model to compute evapotranspiration, surface runoff and soil moisture in the cloud using the USGS Pangeo or other suitable architecture.

Team members are:
Terry Sohl - Principle Investigator
- Specializing in Land use/change modeling
- development of the FORE-SCE (FOREcasting SCEnarios of land-use change) modeling framework
- Published Scientific Author
- representative for the USGS EarthMAP initiative

Ward Sanford - Co-Principle Investigator
- Specializing in regional groundwater flow and transport and water budget
- Published Scientific Author

Gabriel Senay – Co-Principle Investigator/Project Lead
- Specializing in Water Cycle modeling and predictive models
- Published Scientific Author
- Lives to integrate land cover and hydrologic modeling.
- Inventor of the VegET and SSEBop ET model

Stefanie Kagone - Research Scientist/Team Lead (skagone@contractor.usgs.gov)
- Experienced VegET modeler and Python coder
- Highly Responsive Communicator and Motivating Force
- Published Scientific Author

Kul Khand - Reseach Scientist
- Experienced hydrologic modeler
- Published Scientific Author
- Voted best name for a colleague in the WaterSMART project
- He is a Jackrabbit.
- Jumped from the Mountains of Nepal to the Plains of South Dakota
- He had to walk up hill to school for an hour – both ways. :-)
- For me in particular, most of my work is involved in studying how the global change, the land cover change specifically, is impacting water resources … and finding scientific solutions to sustain the available water resources.”
